                    <p>In this project, I developed an Object-Oriented Python program to classify pet images during my Generative AI Externship at Cognizant, with a focus on identifying whether the images contain a dog, and if so, determining the breed. Using three different Convolutional Neural Network architectures — ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG — I explored the effectiveness of each model in achieving these goals. My program also compared the classifier’s results with actual pet labels, making use of file input and handling various data structures. To enhance the program’s efficiency, I incorporated command-line arguments for user inputs and timed the execution of each model to assess its computational performance.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I gained experience in image classification using CNN models and became proficient in evaluating model performance based on accuracy and runtime. I successfully implemented logic to classify images as "dog" or "not dog" using a reference file and achieved accurate breed classification in dog images. The project helped me develop a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between different deep learning model architectures. As a part of my Externship at Cognizant, part of this code (The CNN models themselves) are not mine, therefore I can't share this project on GitHub.</p>

This project was developed as part of the Network Computing course at Dalhousie University, focusing on socket programming and encryption techniques.</p>
                    <p>The Caesar Cipher encryption method shifts each letter of the message by a specific number of positions in the alphabet, determined by a key shared between the client and server. The client requests the key from the server, and all subsequent messages are encrypted using this key before being sent to the server.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Caesar Cipher, which uses a single key, Vigenere Cipher uses a sequence of letters as a secret keyword. The client and server both know the keyword, and the messages are encrypted by shifting each letter according to the corresponding letter in the keyword.</p>
                    <p>The program establishes secure client-server communication using Java sockets and develops both Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher for message encryption and decryption.</p>

The levels increase in complexity, introducing additional enemy lanes and more waves as the player progresses.</p>
                    <p>The game incorporates a robust economic upgrade system that allows players to dynamically grow their population, affecting tax income and other revenue sources like mining, trade, and agriculture. Players can use this income to build three different types of animated towers, each with unique abilities, or invest in their economy for future benefits. Additional features include animated player attacks and movement, unique enemy animations, and dynamic environmental design.</p>
                    <p>I worked alongside three other students on this project. My responsibilities included designing and debugging the level terrains, implementing the castle health system, creating enemy generation mechanics, designing and coding the economy upgrade system, and implementing the tower-purchasing functionality. I also developed and managed user interfaces for tower building, economic upgrades, and game progression (e.g., game over and level completion screens). The project adheres to object-oriented programming principles, with all core game elements managed by instantiable manager scripts, ensuring scalability and modularity.</p>

                    <h3>Xtra Binary Translator: RISC to x86</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>This project implements a binary translator that converts instructions from a simplified 16-bit RISC-based instruction set into x86-64 assembly code. The translator reads binary files containing RISC instructions, decodes them, and outputs their equivalent x86-64 assembly instructions. It handles fundamental operations such as arithmetic (add, sub), data movement (mov), and stack manipulation (push, pop) operations, ensuring that these operations are accurately translated between architectures.</p>
                    <p>The translation process involves mapping RISC registers to x86-64 registers, as the RISC architecture has 16 general-purpose 16-bit registers, while x86-64 uses 64-bit registers. Each instruction is carefully decoded, and the appropriate x86-64 assembly instructions are generated to match the behavior of the original RISC instructions. This project highlights how different architectures manage data and execute operations. This project was developed remotely using Dalhousie University's Faculty of Computer Science Timberlea server, accessed via SSH from a Linux environment for compiling, testing and debugging.</p>

                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>Developed a linked list in C and used it to create a string splicer that reassembles multiple strings by merging their overlapping parts (i.e. the first string's ending matching the second string's beginning). The program reads segments of text, stores them as linked lists, and then reassembles them into a single document based on overlapping content.

                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>Unzipper is a C program that implements a decompression algorithm for a secret compression method. The project has two key components: the decoding table and the decompression process. First, the program reads a series of bytes that represent a decoding table, which holds the bit sequences corresponding to each character in the compressed file. It then outputs this table in a human-readable format. In the second part, the program uses this decoding table to decompress the compressed data. It decodes the bitstream and reconstructs the original text, outputting the decompressed result.</p>
