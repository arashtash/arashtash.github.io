                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>Boardify is a list-sharing web application, inspired by Trello, developed collaboratively with two teammates as part of our Software Engineering course at Dalhousie University. The project involved rotating roles among team members, with each person contributing to both frontend and backend development, and taking turns in leadership roles weekly. We utilized Agile Methodology, delivering the project in iterative milestones, ensuring the application was always functional and presentable. Continuous improvements were made based on feedback from our instructor and teaching assistants, with each sprint introducing new features and refinements.</p>
                    <p>Boardify was developed using React.js (JavaScript library), Spring Boot (Java framework), SQL and Git (for version control) in a Test-Driven Development (TDD) process, with over 70% testing line coverage. The implemented features are user registration, authentication (Login), creating workspaces and adding users to them, creating boards and adding tasks within them, updating task status and searching and filtering tasks.</p>

                    <p>As part of my Data Mining and Warehousing course, I gained hands-on experience with key aspects of Data Mining, including data preprocessing, OLAP, discretization, and applying machine learning algorithms. I worked with real-world datasets, such as COVID-19 data for Nova Scotia, where I focused on data cleaning, structuring, and analysis. I implemented k-means clustering algorithm from scratch and compared its results with Scikit-learnâs version across multiple datasets. Additionally, I utilized classification models like Naive Bayes and Neural Networks to predict outcomes, using Python and its libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.</p>
                    <p>I explored OLAP and discretization concepts, applying them to political data from Brazil, and conducted analysis on the health and environmental impacts of seafood consumption. Using datasets related to nutrition and sustainability, I created visualizations to examine trends in protein consumption, fish stock sustainability, and environmental impacts, providing insights into global seafood production and its effects.</p>

I implemented key algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors for classification and K-means clustering, optimizing the number of clusters using the Silhouette Score and visualizing the results.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I developed and experimented with neural networks for image classification tasks, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-100. I explored different hyperparameters to improve performance and analyzed the generalization of the networks. I also trained convolutional neural networks and implemented a multi-layer perceptron for binary classification.

                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>In this project, I fine-tuned a GPT-2 model for sequence classification using Hugging Face's PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) library. The project involved training and evaluating the model on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/climatebert/climate_sentiment" target="_blank">climatebert/climate_sentiment</a> dataset to classify text into categories of "risk," "neutral," or "opportunity." Initially, I conducted an evaluation of the pre-trained GPT-2 model, achieving an accuracy of 36.5%. After applying PEFT using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), I fine-tuned the model, significantly improving its accuracy to 52% over only four epochs.</p>
                    <p>I implemented and trained both traditional and PEFT models using Python libraries such as NumPy, PyTorch, PEFT and Pandas. This project shows the effectiveness of lightweight fine-tuning for improving model performance while reducing computational complexity.</p>

                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>In this project, I developed an Object-Oriented Python program to classify pet images during my Generative AI Externship at Cognizant, with a focus on identifying whether the images contain a dog, and if so, determining the breed. Using three different Convolutional Neural Network architectures â ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG â I explored the effectiveness of each model in achieving these goals. My program also compared the classifierâs results with actual pet labels, making use of file input and handling various data structures. To enhance the programâs efficiency, I incorporated command-line arguments for user inputs and timed the execution of each model to assess its computational performance.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I gained experience in image classification using CNN models and became proficient in evaluating model performance based on accuracy and runtime. I successfully implemented logic to classify images as "dog" or "not dog" using a reference file and achieved accurate breed classification in dog images. The project helped me develop a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between different deep learning model architectures. As a part of my Externship at Cognizant, part of this code (The CNN models themselves) are not mine, therefore I can't share this project on GitHub.</p>
